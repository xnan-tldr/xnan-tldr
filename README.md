### Since we are here

@amitay Amitay, it was nice to talk to you during my first week at Yahoo’s Fantasy team. I am quite fond of your communities in Israel. I have many close friendships and even family, like one of my rare uncles, like Ricardo, an electronics engineer who is the best friend of my father’s brother. I have long lived friendships and bizarre affairs, both with Azquenazy and Sefaradis. Always bright, always funny, always fond company. I am leaving the company this week, and chances to meet at a new hire’s talks plummeted. But I want to take a moment to tell you a few more words about my friends and the adventures we had, like the first I had with Mijail.

 
 # MAIQUI
 ## TLDR 

I met Mijail in Numerical Methods class for Computer Science at the Uni, he was in the top three rank of rank of eccentricity in the building, the first and second places were shared by the blind teacher of Linear Algebra wich wrote his blind algebraic operations into blackboard numbers, or the the esquizofrenic of Numerical Calculus, then was Micky, reaching classes in his blazing fast roller skating from somewhere in the nearby throughout the Exact faculty hall, and likely quite frequently when getting too late to class or exams, straight to class rooms, corridors and stairways in the middle.

 Always bouncing between being amused, loved or hated. Anarchist at heart, Liberal by pragmatism. Quite a rara avis. At that moment when we were in our middle twenties he was somewhat entertained as a part time researcher at molecular biology, doing some super nerdy stuff like simulating protein folding with NVidia graphic cards, if I recall correctly. 

One year earlier, I was in the course of Complex Systems which led me to start writing “what if” tales where the main thread between them was that argentine political representatives were rocketed to mars and had the first encounters with martians after being rendered unemployed under a direct democracy take over. 

The takeover was inspired from my course when I was exposed to Monte Carlo processes modeled by physicists which reached a stable equilibrium from stochastic sources. Too abstract sounding. But behind the physics nerdy jargon was a very simple but quite interesting and practical set of concepts. 

In those days, we were using Yahoo’s forums, and in this terms It is quite simple to kraft those buzz words into something grounded, like a practical way to get a direct democracy for well, something quite bigger than the few thousand citizens that raise hands in Switzerland to decide if a given policy must be applied by the Citizenship or not. It can be done for masses this way, 

People (stochastic source), being a thousand or hundred thousand, just pick and discuss policies on a hierarchically organized platform for topics and subtopics as reddit now does and just vote there, the results after polls are the stable equilibrium in nerdo lingo. I have simpler models, but that’s another story. 

We have the people, then, each Reddit of the former Subreddit is another stage discussing and polling, let's say the higher reddit is the bird’s eye view, like a low flying duck’s view, narrowed to the polled decision of the subreddits. The next one, was the colomb’s view, I know, you already got it. 

So, I had my political model (which had far too many fork ideas from friends and family), a hardly ever exercised  scalable alternative to the Greek one. 

So, I had my Argentine politicians and to lift all of them to mars I needed to read (obviously) a good backpack loaded with books, either from current politicians or from the old days, to get enough gas. That gas would allow me to reach a compilation that could evolve, with time into the same creative process that led Ray Bradbury to coin his marvel titled Martian Chronicles. I got an unpredictable curiosity for political affairs which led me to Facundo by far one of the most beautiful prose in spanish about a butcher that turned by blood the country's new born federal state system like now you have USA into a Unitary non functional one mocked as hybrid.

Amitay, what was I saying? Oh, yes,  I ended up getting my fun writing and an impracticable political model. 

Then I met Maiqui, he nagged me to listen to his political interests, and his political model draft. His plan was fairly simple, since a direct democracy was impractical for more than a few Roman civitas. He took the idea from the general concept under the  DoS resistant attack version of a sorting algorithm to state it in layman’s words, but we, he said,  just use our own forum like Yahoo’s has. But with subforums, where people just vote, then we go bottom up and  blah, blah, you can imagine. Of course, I got his novel idea after a few minutes of profound thinking. 

So,I turned left with my martians and he turned right with his seemingly naive pragmatism. 

Then I shot: how are you going to get any political organization, to try it, and almost pat him on the head like a good dog. Then, he says, easy! 

We go full Guerrilla, from small organizations then to bigger ones. 

I fired again. 

So, you are going to drag like what, a hundred guys politically inclined, to this? I almost gave him a candy, like a kid sobbing, Then told two or more things and the idea was obvious. We do it, using the main strategy USA and URSS  or for the layman in HTTP Server Caching by Proxy,a bunch of us, and with the rest  we gain enough votes to win the elections. everything was ready to start the try take over

Since,

### I WAS RECRUITED

## TO THE FIRST GUERRILLA OPERATION

# ATTACK TO THE STUDENTS COUNCIL
# BY PROXY

So, that’s all. Can’t help but tell an embarrassing memory on math.

#
PS: Since we taught a bit about politics, I thought you might find the story somewhat funny. BTW, I was not thinking at all at Maiqui for a long time, we didn’t see each other after the days at the UNI. Since then, twenty years have passed, but yesterday. OUT OF THE BLUE. Maiqui and I met again.

* you might get a bit more abstract example of the aforementioned processes  in relation to the pivot point of the sorting algorithm called QuickSort, which picks it at the middle of the array and afterwards throws numbers to the left or right of the pivot; if we pick the pivot at random we reach again two array at as stable equilibrium, by repetition at smaller chunks we end up with what is known as a Monte Carlo algorithm in mathematician mumble jumble.
